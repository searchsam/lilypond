1. God rest you, merry Gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,
Remenber Christ our Saviour,
Was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray;

O tidings comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

2. In Bethlehem, in Jewry,
This bleffed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger,
Upon this bleffed Morn;
The which His Mather Mary,
Did nothing take in fcorn.
O tidings...

3. From God our Heavenly Father,
A bleffed Angel came;
And unto certian Shepherds
Brought tifings of the fame:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.
O tidings...

4. Fear not then faid the Angel,
Let nothing you affrigth,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all thofe who truft in Him
From Satan's power and might.
O tidings...

5. The Shepherds at thofe tidings,
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feedings,
In tempeft, ftorm, and wind:
And went to Bethlehem ftraightway,
The Son of God to find.
O tidings...

6. And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings...

7. Now to the Lord fing praifes,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Chriftmas
All other doth deface.
O tidings...
